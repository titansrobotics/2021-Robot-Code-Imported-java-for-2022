Team 8174's Complete 2022 Codebase - Written in Java

This Code was written by Justin in 2019-20 and dramatically altered by
Andy Bennett in 2021-22
if you need help my discord is probably still active: Andy The Goat#2634

I've added notes to explain things where I think it's needed. To change the 
code I think it's easiest to copy what's already been done into new commands/subsystems, and then
build them into the constants, main, robot, robotcontainer files as necessary. I didn't learn every
single part of the API, just built off of the work that came before me! If this code base is used again
in the future that's what you should do too!

-------IMPORTANT-------
Your #1 tool is right-clicking a piece of code and exploring the context menu to see where it is 
defined, referenced, and what a function does, what variables it accepts, etc etc
This is the magic of extensions in VSCode and helps you quickly build an understanding of how the code works. 
Good luck!

  ^^ excellent resource for learning how to build up a robot. See all the links on the left bar

Programs:
Java SDK or JDK or smthn I don't remember anymore lol
VSCode
WPILib VSCode Extension
FRC Driver Tools
CAN {CAN is the way we assign numbers to motors and control them. 
PWM does the same thing but it's less fancy and we didn't use it this year.} tools: REV SPARK MAX Client, CTRE Phoenix Tuner
I'm sure there are more I forgot, you'll figure it out
